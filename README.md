# Preprocessing_and_Segmentation_Evaluation_PET
File segment_validation_images.py includes the codes to preprocess, segment, and evaluate the validation images (i.e. the images not used to identify the best preprocessing approaches). The other .py files include helper functions used in the segmentation pipeline (and fair bunch of approaches that we tested, but did not include in the best identified pipeline).
